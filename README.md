Thank you for the opportunity!

However, I must express my concerns regarding the level of micromanagement and restrictive policies I have encountered here. The management’s approach has often been inadequate, and it is clear that there is limited opportunity for growth or advancement. The lack of technical understanding from leadership has further compounded these issues, making it increasingly difficult for me to contribute effectively.

As a developer, I would also suggest that management should ideally be in the hands of individuals with strong technical knowledge. This would facilitate better decision-making and foster an environment where technical staff can thrive.

Despite my efforts to address these concerns constructively, I have not seen any meaningful changes. Consequently, I believe that seeking a new position elsewhere is the best step for my professional development.

I appreciate the experiences I’ve gained during my time here and wish the company continued success.
